# Fine-Tuning-a-Large-Language-Model

Project Overview
This project fine-tunes the pre-trained distilbert-base-uncased transformer model on the IMDb movie review dataset to classify sentiments into positive or negative categories. The objective is to improve the performance of the base model for domain-specific sentiment classification tasks through fine-tuning and evaluation.

# Environment Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Download and extract the project folder.

2. Set up Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate            # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run the Project
-Training the Model
python scripts/train.py
Fine-tunes the distilbert-base-uncased model on the IMDb dataset.
Saves the trained model and tokenizer to scripts/models/final-model/.
-Evaluating the Fine-Tuned Model
python scripts/eval_model.py
Loads the saved fine-tuned model.
Evaluates on the test split of the IMDb dataset.
Prints the evaluation metric (accuracy)

# Dependencies

transformers==4.39.3
datasets==2.16.1
evaluate==0.4.1
accelerate==0.27.2
torch>=1.10
scikit-learn

Dataset Used
IMDb Movie Review Dataset

Sourced via the Hugging Face Datasets library:
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")

# Model Architecture
Base Model: distilbert-base-uncased (Distilled BERT)

Task: Sequence Classification (Binary Sentiment: Positive / Negative)

Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss (handled by Hugging Face Trainer)

# Error Analysis
Misclassified examples were primarily observed in cases of:

Sarcasm

Mixed sentiments

Complex and ambiguous language

Potential improvements:

Hyperparameter tuning

Additional epochs

Larger models like BERT-base or RoBERTa

# Limitations and Future Work

Current model was trained with default hyperparameters and limited epochs.

Future improvements could include:

Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, epochs, batch size)

Advanced error analysis with confusion matrix

Testing with larger or alternative models

# Reproducibility

Virtual environment setup using Python venv.

All dependencies are pinned in requirements.txt.

Model checkpoints and tokenizer saved for reusability.
